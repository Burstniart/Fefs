1. Create a server: Here we create one using node
The template used is the simpleServer.js file, which is runned with node and that creates our server.

1. Get a server: Right now I got a Digital Ocean server running Ubuntu 20 LTS, apparently I could get an Azure or AWS server running, for know I'm using some credits given to me to use un Digital ocean but since it requires the minimum you can get a server up and running for 6 dollars a month, again this is for basic tiers on this cloud providers, maybe there are some free tiers out there that work for small projectsFly.io and Oracle Cloud I'm looking at both of you.

	1. Generate your ssh key: ssh-keygen generates ssh keys which you then use to log in your server.
